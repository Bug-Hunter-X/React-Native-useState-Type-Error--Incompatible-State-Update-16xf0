The solution involves ensuring that the type of value used to update the state variable is consistent with its initial type.  This often involves using type guards or more carefully managing data flow to prevent type mismatches.  Here's a corrected example:

```javascript
// Correct usage:
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // Initialized as a number

  const updateCount = () => {
    setCount(count + 1); // Update with a number
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
      <Button title="Update" onPress={updateCount} />
    </View>
  );
};
```

**Key Improvements:**

* **Type Consistency:** The `updateCount` function now uses `count + 1` to update the `count` state variable. This ensures the new value remains a number, preventing the type error.
* **Data Validation (Optional):**  For more complex scenarios, you can introduce data validation before updating state.  This can involve checks to ensure data is in the expected format. 

By adhering to type consistency, you'll avoid unexpected behavior and make your React Native application more robust.
