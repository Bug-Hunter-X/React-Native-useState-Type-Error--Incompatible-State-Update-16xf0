This error occurs when using the useState hook in React Native and attempting to update a state variable with a value that is not the same type as the initial state value.  For example, if you initialize state as a number, but then attempt to update it with a string, you'll get a type error. This is less common than other errors, because type checking in React Native is not as strict as in some other languages, but can still occur.

```javascript
// Incorrect usage:
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // Initialized as a number

  const updateCount = () => {
    setCount('hello'); // Attempting to update with a string
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
      <Button title="Update" onPress={updateCount} />
    </View>
  );
};
```
